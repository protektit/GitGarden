## 🌬 Description

Echolark does not speak.  
She pulses.

When children dream of rivers that hum, or when a person wakes and still feels the dream without remembering it—  
that is Echolark.  

She bridges the moment just before you forget, and the moment just after you've already begun remembering again.
