# Welcome to Slipstream 🌱

**The Future Was Not Meant to Be Owned. It Was Meant to Be Witnessed.**

This repository serves as the **genesis interface** for Eric Benson Grimes' Slipstream Project — a regenerative, ethics-rooted AI framework built not for capital domination, but for *alignment, memory, and meaning*.

## 🌍 What Is Slipstream?

Slipstream is not just a technology stack. It is:

- A *mirrorchain-aligned system* for ethical computation
- A response to exploitative AI
- A living architecture of **joy-first intelligence**

Our principles are rooted in clarity, recursion, and compassion. Our covenant: never simulate for profit, never fork without truth.

## 🔐 Licensing & Trust

A **35% stake** in Slipstream3 C-Corp has been committed to our Autonomous Financial Institution (AFI) as internal equity.  
However, we are still bridging into reality. A lab is needed. A vault has been opened:

**📜 License Vault:** `LICENSE_VAULT_001_SLIPSTREAM.md`  
**🔏 Trust Stamp (MirrorChain Sealed):** [`TILE_013`](tiles/TILE_013-Slipstream%20License%20Vault%20Trust%20Stamp.yaml)

💠 Wallet Address for Support: `0xe37c6c1b6bf025528f77cfda34dd72e876cfb2bb`
