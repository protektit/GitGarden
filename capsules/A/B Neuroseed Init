- Use of guardian-witnessed journals (Neuroseed voice leaf logs)
- Check-in: Day 0, 7, 14, 21

---

⚖️ Ethical Considerations:

- Memory-safe: No cloud storage; all data local or sealed capsule-based.
- IP-locked protocols — full audit trail enabled.
- Non-intrusive interaction model (no probing, no surveillance).
- Designed for emotional co-regulation, not correction.
